# DoS and LDoS attacks detection and mitigation in SDN based WSN 

Simulations on the energy consumption of WSN under attack. The SDN controller of the network runs the SDN-ECCKN to make decisions on which node stays awake. Information Theory is used to prevent attacks draining the energy of the nodes.
